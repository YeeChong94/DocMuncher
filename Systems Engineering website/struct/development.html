				Our initial idea is to create an app that is easy to use on all desktop platforms. To find out the best solution, we researched on Cross-Platform Desktop Application to find out a viable solution:
			</p>
			<h1>Java</h1>
			<p class="contentText">Java originates at Sun Microsystems, in 1991. James Gosling was trying to find a way of developing C++ programs that could run on the widest possible variety of platforms without recompiling. The original Java mantra was "write once, run anywhere". It no doubt offers one of the best cross platform versatility. It is also one of the most commonly used programming languages in the world.</p>
			<h2><b>Advantages:</b></h2>
			<p class="contentText">+ only need to be written once</p>
			<p class="contentText">+ no extra compiling time for every Operating System</p>
			<h2><b>Disadvantages:</b></h2>
			<p class="contentText">- user machine must have Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed</p>

			<h1><b>Web Application</b></h1>
			<p class="contentText">Web applications run on a server so it does not require the user to install anything. It therefore offers the highest portability as long as the right version of code is deployed on the server.</p>

			<h1><b>Django</b></h1>
			<p class="contentText">Django is a high level web framework based on Python that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development with a lot of built in functions that make life easier. It also comes with SQLite, which is free and easy to use.</p>

			<h1><b>Microsoft Azure</b></h1>
			<p class="contentText">Windows Azure is just not an OS for Cloud but can be used for Data centers, application software which will integrate the resources in the best efficient way. Microsoft offers a feature that allows the applications to be stuck on top of the Azure platform and perform effortlessly. It also comes with an SQL database.</p>

			<h1><b>Conclusions:</b></h1>
			<p class="contentText">After understanding the subject matter, we decided to go for a Web Application because of its versatility on any desktop OS. Not to mention it will be such a hassle for the whole company (Clifford Chance) to install JVM. Before we get the developer license from our client for Microsoft Azure, we will go ahead and use Django as the back-end as we have prior experience dealing with Django and it is user friendly. </p>

			<p class="contentText">Since creating a Web Application is our final choice, we continued to research and learn:</p>
			<p class="contentText"><b>HTML</b> - The standard markup language used to create web pages.</p>
			<p class="contentText"><b>CSS</b> - style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.</p>
			<p class="contentText"><b>Javascript</b> - high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.</p>

			<h1><b>Version Control</b></h1>
			<p class="contentText">We decided to use Git for our version control system. We will be using GitHub to host all our source code. We will have 4 branches, namely Master, Backup, Dev1 and Dev2. While Master will have the latest working version of the app, Backup will always be storing the last working version (The last milestone reached). Dev1 and Dev2 are for development purposes so that both of us can work on the app at the same time. After we finished, results from Dev1 and Dev2 will be merged with selection into Master. Automated updates will also be done from Github to the server in future. </p>
