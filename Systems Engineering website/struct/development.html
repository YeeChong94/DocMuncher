			<h1 class='superH1'>Term 2</h1>
			<h1>Evaluation of the Final Solution</h1>
			<p class='contentText'>We are quite happy with the outcome, as we managed to hit all the key requirements. We made sure that at every step of the way, the user knows exactly what they are doing, and what information they are looking at. Our data visualisation is straightforward and is based on charts that  are familiar to the average person. There is no need to learn how to read the data analysis, which makes the system easy to use for both experienced and inexperienced users.</p>
			<p class='contentText'>We even managed to add in some extra functionality. The pie-chart is interactive, so users can get much more specific information. When clicking on the green slice, you get a chart that accounts only for the risk-free documents  Also, both charts can be exported. This can help with end-of-the-project reports or with justifying different decisions and keeping track of the evidence backing them up.</p>
			<p class='contentText'>We really think that once put together, this project can have a great impact on the industry, by automating a very tedious and error-prone process.</p>
			<h1>Iterations and Forks in Prototypes</h1>
			<h2>FIRST ITERATION</h2>
			<p class='contentText'>The first iteration of the app was the tabbed menu as well as the Home Page that are colour coded with simple text display. We used the main colours from Clifford Chance website. This proved to be very useful to show to our client how we envisioned the app and discuss on what should be included next.</p>
			<h2>SECOND ITERATION</h2>
			<p class='contentText'>The second iteration of the app had more details in every tab of the web app especially home page, clusters overview, document overview and saved document. This enables us to show our client the way the app should be working and obtain feedbacks from him so that we could improve.</p>
			<h2>THIRD ITERATION</h2>
			<p class='contentText'>The third iteration of the app involves the change of homepage display to show the list of projects in a more elegant and efficient way. We changed the horizontal tabs to vertical tabs to avoid the problem with display space.</p>
			<h2>FOURTH ITERATION</h2>
			<p class='contentText'>During this iteration, we created login, register and forgot password pages, however, having discussed it with our client, we decided to take this out because it is not vital for the web app.</p>
			<h2>FIFTH ITERATION</h2>
			<p class='contentText'>The fifth iteration of the app involves implementation of cluster pie chart and 2D table to display clusters and documents. This is one of the key challenge of the app as the we were unable to obtain accurate and reliable results from team 39 and team 40 for visualisation. After having discussion with our client, we decided to use mock data.</p>
			<h2>SIXTH ITERATION</h2>
			<p class='contentText'>Our sixth iteration was one of the longest ones, as we were unable implement a database that make perfect sense to the app. Finally, we decided to use Django as the backend and AngularJS as the front-end.</p>
			<h2>SEVENTH ITERATION</h2>
			<p class='contentText'>The seventh iteration fixes several linking issues for the visualisation and the database.</p>
			</br>
			<h2>FORKS ON GITHUB</h2>
			<p class='contentText'>Master now contains the full version of the app.</p>
			</br>
			<h1>Reference materials cited and examples/trials made</h1>
			<p class='contentText'>Throughout the development of the product, we referenced a few websites and guides to ensure we are making satisfactory product to our client.</p>

			<h2>The Clifford Chance website</h2>
			<p class='contentText'><a href="http://www.cliffordchance.com">link to website</a></p>
			<p class='contentText'>As one of our clients, we were inspired by the colour coded company website and think it's a good idea to implement colour coded tabs into our web app as well, so we used the Clifford Chance colour scheme as the main colours of the web app.</p>

			<h2>AngularJS Tutorials</h2>
			<p class='contentText'><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/angular/" >W3Schools</a></p>
			<p class='contentText'><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/angularjs/" >TutiorialsPoint</a></p>
			<p class='contentText'><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-angularjs" >CodeAcademy</a></p>
			<ul class="contentText">
				<li>AngularJS provides capability to create Single Page Application in a very clean and maintainable way.</li>
				<li>AngularJS provides data binding capability to HTML thus giving user a rich and responsive experience</li>
				<li>AngularJS code is unit testable.</li>
				<li>TAngularJS uses dependency injection and make use of separation of concerns.</li>
				<li>AngularJS provides reusable components.</li>
				<li>With AngularJS, developers write less code and get more functionality.</li>
				<li>In AngularJS, views are pure html pages, and controllers written in JavaScript do the business processing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class='contentText'>On top of everything, AngularJS applications can run on all major browsers and smart phones including Android and iOS based phones/tablets.</p>

			<h1>Django and AngularJS Implementation:</h1>
			<p class='contentText'><a href="https://github.com/abdullatheef/django_angular" >GitHub Repo</a></p>
			<p class='contentText'>We referenced this Github repository to get an idea how Django and AngularJS can be implemented together to help the development of web app.</p>

			<h1>Trials:</h1>
			<p class='contentText'><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/" >Link here</a></p>
			<p class='contentText'>A simple questionnaire app was made using Django under the guidance of this tutorial to test out the database.</p>
			

			<h1 class='superH1'>Term 1</h1>
			<p class="contentText">
				Our initial idea is to create an app that is easy to use on all desktop platforms. To find out the best solution, we researched on Cross-Platform Desktop Application to find out a viable solution:
			</p>
			<h1>Java</h1>
			<p class="contentText">Java originates at Sun Microsystems, in 1991. James Gosling was trying to find a way of developing C++ programs that could run on the widest possible variety of platforms without recompiling. The original Java mantra was "write once, run anywhere". It no doubt offers one of the best cross platform versatility. It is also one of the most commonly used programming languages in the world.</p>
			<h2><b>Advantages:</b></h2>
			<p class="contentText">+ only need to be written once</p>
			<p class="contentText">+ no extra compiling time for every Operating System</p>
			<h2><b>Disadvantages:</b></h2>
			<p class="contentText">- user machine must have Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed</p>

			<h1><b>Web Application</b></h1>
			<p class="contentText">Web applications run on a server so it does not require the user to install anything. It therefore offers the highest portability as long as the right version of code is deployed on the server.</p>

			<h1><b>Django</b></h1>
			<p class="contentText">Django is a high level web framework based on Python that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development with a lot of built in functions that make life easier. It also comes with SQLite, which is free and easy to use.</p>

			<h1><b>Microsoft Azure</b></h1>
			<p class="contentText">Windows Azure is just not an OS for Cloud but can be used for Data centers, application software which will integrate the resources in the best efficient way. Microsoft offers a feature that allows the applications to be stuck on top of the Azure platform and perform effortlessly. It also comes with an SQL database.</p>

			<h1><b>Conclusions:</b></h1>
			<p class="contentText">After understanding the subject matter, we decided to go for a Web Application because of its versatility on any desktop OS. Not to mention it will be such a hassle for the whole company (Clifford Chance) to install JVM. Before we get the developer license from our client for Microsoft Azure, we will go ahead and use Django as the back-end as we have prior experience dealing with Django and it is user friendly. </p>

			<p class="contentText">Since creating a Web Application is our final choice, we continued to research and learn:</p>
			<p class="contentText"><b>HTML</b> - The standard markup language used to create web pages.</p>
			<p class="contentText"><b>CSS</b> - style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.</p>
			<p class="contentText"><b>Javascript</b> - high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.</p>

			<h1><b>Version Control</b></h1>
			<p class="contentText">We decided to use Git for our version control system. We will be using GitHub to host all our source code. We will have 4 branches, namely Master, Backup, Dev1 and Dev2. While Master will have the latest working version of the app, Backup will always be storing the last working version (The last milestone reached). Dev1 and Dev2 are for development purposes so that both of us can work on the app at the same time. After we finished, results from Dev1 and Dev2 will be merged with selection into Master. Automated updates will also be done from Github to the server in future. </p>
