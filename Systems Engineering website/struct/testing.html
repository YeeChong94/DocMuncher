			<h1>Testing Strategy</h1>
			<p class="contentText">
				
			<h2>Unit Testing </h2>
			<p class="contentText">Unit testing will be conducted as coding progresses - we will ensure each function works before committing to our repository.</p>

			<h2>Integration Testing</h2>
			<p class="contentText">Integration testing will be conducted after we merged both working Dev1 and Dev2 branches into the Master branch. We will be testing all the functions as a whole.</p> 

			<h2>Functional Testing</h2>
			<p class="contentText">Functional testing aims to ensure the MoSCoW requirements agreed by the client and us are fulfilled and on-track.</p>

			<h2>User Acceptance Testing</h2>
			<p class="contentText">We will be checking with our client about the User Acceptance every 2 weeks in the biweekly client meeting to ensure that our client is satisfied with our project development.</p>

			<h2>Automated Web Application testing:</h2>
			<p class="contentText">With web application testing, issues such as website functionality, security, accessibility, usability, compatibility and performance are uncovered before the web application is released to the public. We did our research on quite a few automated testing tools available, and narrowed our scope to those following:</p>

			<h2>For Overall Load Testing: Apache JMeter</h2>
			<p class="contentText">It is an Apache Open source load testing tool, written in Java 6+ and supports all platforms. Recently, Apache released the stable version of JMeter "v2.11" that supports all platforms.</br>
			Basically, JMeter is used for load testing and to analysing and measuring the performance of system/application.</br>
			Also, this tool is helpful in testing JDBC database connections (FTP, LDAP, Web services, JMS, HTTP, HTTPS, TCP connections) and OS Native processes. It analyses overall performance under different load on a server, group of servers and network place.</br>
			Capability to check the performance of the SOAP, LDAP, Message-oriented middleware (MOM) via JMS, Mail (SMTP(S), POP3(S) and IMAP(S)), MongoDB (NoSQL), and Native commands or shell scripts. Its strong GUI design helps in fast building of Test Plan and debugging process.</br>

			<h2>For Load Testing: Loadster</h2>
			<p class="contentText">A commercial load testing tool to test websites, web applications/services (HTTP web services) and to simulate and guess how web applications will perform under heavy load, given by Loadster, supports Linux, Mac, and Windows. This full-features tool works on actual web applications/services cookies, sessions, custom header, dynamic form of data, etc.</br>
			Loadster is used to test the performance, stability, and scalability of web applications/services and websites. It simulates numbers of users, networking with the site and collects stats for each virtual user distinctly. Load testing assists to determine performance bottlenecks, expect and avoid crashes, and confirm your application can handle high traffic events.</br>

			<h2>For Web Functional/Regression Testing: Selenium</h2>
			<p class="contentText">Selenium is one of the most popular automated testing suites. Selenium is designed to support and encourage automation testing of functional aspects of web based applications and a wide range of browsers and platforms.</br>
			Selenium suite is comprised of 4 basic components; Selenium IDE, Selenium RC, WebDriver, Selenium Grid. Selenium IDE is Firefox add-on for record-and-playback web application tests. WebDriver directly communicates with the web browser and uses its native compatibility to automate.</br>
